Crop Recommendation System to help achieve zero hunger

Introduction to SDG 2: Zero Hunger
The UN Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2) aims to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture by 2030. This goal is crucial as it addresses the fundamental human right to food and seeks to eliminate the root causes of hunger and malnutrition globally. SDG 2 emphasizes the need for sustainable agricultural practices that increase productivity, improve the livelihoods of farmers, and ensure that food systems are resilient to climate change and other challenges.

Specific Problem: Unpredictable Crop Yields
One of the major challenges facing farmers, especially in developing regions, is the unpredictability of crop yields. Factors such as climate variability, soil health, and inadequate farming practices contribute to fluctuating crop yields, making it difficult for farmers to plan and manage their resources effectively. This unpredictability not only affects farmersâ€™ incomes but also contributes to food insecurity in the broader community.

Machine Learning Application: Crop Recommendation System
Objective
The primary objective of the Crop Recommendation System is to provide farmers with accurate recommendations on what crops to plant based on various input features such as weather conditions, soil characteristics, and historical crop data. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the system aims to help farmers make informed decisions, optimize their farming practices, and increase agricultural productivity and food security.
